## Project Overview
Welcome to the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree!

In this project, decision functions will be created that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passengerâ€™s features, such as sex and age. it will start with a simple algorithm and increase its complexity until it will be able to accurately predict the outcomes for at least 80% of the passengers in the provided data. This project will introduce some of the concepts of machine learning.
