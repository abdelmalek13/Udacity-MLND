    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "### Logistic Regression \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is  logistic Regression ?\n",
    "It's a classification Algorithm, used to predict discrete outcome given a set of categorical variables, we can think it as special case of Linear regression, except that it doesn't try to predict the value of a numeric variable given a set of inputs, Instead the output is a  probability that the given input point belongs to a certain class, by using a boundary( a line in 2D and plane in 3D).\n",
    "The prediction is carried out using a non-linear function called the sigmoid function ![320px-Logistic-curve.png](attachment:320px-Logistic-curve.png)\n",
    "where $h_x(\\theta) = g(\\theta^{T}x) --> g(z)=\\frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How it works ?\n",
    "###### To estimate the coefficients of the equation\n",
    "1. Calculate a prediction using the current values of the coefficients \n",
    "2. Calculate new values of the coefficients based on the error in prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "###### How the model update the coefficients(learning)\n",
    "1. Batch learning \n",
    "    * Scan all data before building a model \n",
    "    * Data must be stored in memory or storage \n",
    "2. Online learning \n",
    "    * Model will be updated each data sample \n",
    "    * Sometimes the online model converges to the batch model \n",
    "\n",
    "###### measure the performance \n",
    "1. **R2 Score** It's how far your split deviate from the ideal model where : $R_{2} = 1-\\frac{e_{curve}}{e_{simple}}$  \n",
    "and your model is getting better as the R2 decreases \n",
    "2. **Accuracy** $Acc = \\frac{TP+TN}{all data}$  \n",
    "As the accuracy increase, the model is getting better \n",
    "3. **ROC** It's a curve that plots the sensitivity and 1-specificity, and as the area under the curve increases the predictive power increases \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages \n",
    "* Fast and simple \n",
    "* very efficient in models with 1 Dimension boundary \n",
    "* Low variance so less pruning to over-fitting\n",
    "* Provide probabilities to the outcomes \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantages \n",
    "* High Bias --> since it's very simple \n",
    "* Can't have continuous outcomes\n",
    "* need large data sample \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applications \n",
    "* Image segmentation \n",
    "* handwritten recognition \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python code\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n",
    "clf = LogisticRegression()\n",
    "### after fitting we can use this line of code to know the coef of the model\n",
    "clf.coef_\n",

    "### K Nearest Neighbor\n",
    "#### What is KNN ?\n",
    "It's a simple algorithm that stores all available cases and classifies new cases based on a similarity measure, a case is classified by a majority vote of its neighbours.\n",
    "It's an instance Based method where we keep the data and use it when we make a query \n",
    "###### How to choose K ?\n",
    "Actually I don't know , In the course told us that using locally weighted regression we could draw a graph by taking k=n , and some guys told me that the best is to set $ k = \\sqrt{n}$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How KNN works ?\n",
    "1. Assign K a value - perferably a small odd number(still in doubt)\n",
    "2. Find the closest number of k points \n",
    "3. Assign the new point from the majority of classes \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantage\n",
    "* simple \n",
    "* Flexible to features \n",
    "* can handle multiclass cases easily\n",
    "* can respond to the changes in inputs (lazy learner)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantages\n",
    "* large time in search(query)\n",
    "* storage of data \n",
    "* dimensionality curse \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Application\n",
    "* ConceptSearch \n",
    "* Recommendation systems \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python \n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\n",
    "\n",
    "clf=KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors = 3)\n",
    "clf.fit(x,y)\n",

    "### Decision Tree\n",
    "#### What is Decision Tree ?\n",
    "It's an algorithm that simulates a graph that uses a branching method to illustrate eveery possible outcome of a decision\n",
    "###### Types of Decision Trees ?\n",
    "1. Categorical Variable Decision Tree \n",
    "2. Continous Variable Decision Tree \n",
    "\n",
    "###### Tree structure \n",
    "![Decision_Tree_2.png](attachment:Decision_Tree_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How Decision Tree works ?\n",
    "Decision trees uses some algorithms one of them is ID3 where it uses the information gain to decide \n",
    "\n",
    "ID3 alg:\n",
    "1. Calculate entropy of a node where  \n",
    "$Entropy = -p log_2p-q log_2q$\n",
    "2. The dataset is split on the different attributes \n",
    "3. choose attribute with the largest \n",
    "4. A branch with entropy more than 0 needs further splitting while the branch with 0 entropy is a leaf node \n",
    "5. The ID3 algorithm is run recursively on the non-leaf branches \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantage \n",
    "1. logarithmic runtime \n",
    "2. Non-linear features doesn't affect the model greatly \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantages \n",
    "The main disadvantage is overfitting \n",
    "in which we can overcome using \n",
    "1. **Tree Pruning** is removing sub-nodes of a decision nodes \n",
    "2. using **constraints on tree size** which are numbers defined the features to be used and the are: Minimum samples for anode split  - minimum samples for terminal node - maximum depth of the tree - maximum number of terminal node - max features to consider for split \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applications \n",
    "Real time apllication example will be troubleshooting applications that use yes or no questions alot \n",
    "\n",
    "#### python code \n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\n",
    "\n",
    "clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(criterion='entropy',random=0)\n",

    "### Gaussian NB ( naive Bayes)\n",
    "#### What is naive Bayes ?\n",
    "- It's a classification technique  based on Bayes rule (explained later) with an assumption of Indepency among predictors.\n",
    "- ###### Bayes Rule \n",
    "    - Bayes Theorem is a way to calculating posterior probability \n",
    "    \n",
    "    $P(c|x)=\\frac{P(x|c)*P(c)}{P(x)}$ , where :\n",
    "    \n",
    "    P(c|x) is the posterior probability of class given predictor\n",
    "    \n",
    "    P(c) is the prior probability of a class \n",
    "    \n",
    "    P(x|c) is the likelihood which is the probability of predictor given the class \n",
    "    \n",
    "    P(x) is the probability of predictor\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### How does naive Bayes work ?\n",
    "1. Convert dataset into frequency table \n",
    "2. Fom a likelihood table (frequency of each category happening or not over the total number of that category)\n",
    "3. Use Bayesian equation to calculate posterior probability and the class with high posterior probability is the outcome of prediction \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages \n",
    "- fast (compared to the other models) --> it can be used in real time predictions \n",
    "- performs well in multiclass predictions --> it can be used in Multi class predictions  \n",
    "- In case of Independent features or predictors it performs very well also in case of categorical data it performs very well compared to numerical data  --> it can be used in text classification , spam filtering and sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantages & How to overcome them \n",
    "- if the categorical data has a variable that was not observed in training data , then model will assign 0 probability and will be unable to make a prediction --> we can apply smoothing techniques like \"Laplace Correction\" \n",
    "- probability outputs arent very accurate (bad estimator) --> You can use it whenever you don’t need the actual probabilities for each class, but only to know which is the most likely. so it cant help much in accurate probabilities\n",
    "- It assumes that all predictor features are independent which is very NAIVE --> actually , I dont know :D but I think that it cant help if the predictors are dependent.\n",
    "- It can't deal with numerical data unless it's normally distributed --> Use transformation or other method to make it normal.\n",
    "- The data shouldn't be highly correlated as we will have a double vote issue --> remove correlated features \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python coding \n",
    "**note :** Naive Bayes has 3 types :\n",
    "1. Gaussian : It assumes features follow normal distribution \n",
    "2. Multinomial : It's used for discrete count \n",
    "3. Bernouli : Binomial model useful if the feature vectors are binary \n",
    "\n",
    "**Gaussian example**:\n",
    "\n",

    "### Stochastic gradient descent (SGDC)\n",
    "#### what is SGDC ?\n",
    "It's a linear model algorithm , that calculates the derivative from each training data instance and calculating the update immediately\n",
    "#### How it works?\n",
    "1. shuffle the dataset; Inorder to mix up the order in which the coefficients are updated \n",
    "2. Update the coefficients after each training instance, so the updates will be noisy jumping all over the place, and so will the corresponding cost function,so will neep more steps.By mixing up the order for the updates to the coefficients, it harnesses this random walk and avoids it getting distracted or stuck\n",
    "3. It's similar to the gradient descent except the cost is not summed over all training patterns, but instead calculated for one training pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages \n",
    "It's main advantages that it's way faster than the gradient descent so it's perfect for the large data set.\n",
    "#### Disadvantages\n",
    "it needs LARGE data in order to do well \n",
    "#### App\n",
    "used mainly in big data applications\n",
    "#### Python code \n",
    "there are three loss function in SGDClassifier\n",
    "1. \"hinge\" which is linear supported vector machine , which is lazy so only updates the model parameters if an example violates the margin constraint\n",

    "In case that we can't linear sperate the classes we should use a kernel trick, and it's transfering the dataset to another dimension in order to seperate them \n",
    "#### Advantages\n",
    "* High Accuracy\n",
    "* works well on smaller cleaner dataset\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Apps\n",
    "SVM is used for text classification tasks such as category assignment, detecting spam and sentiment analysis.

    "### Ensemble lerning \n",
    "#### What is Ensemble learning ?\n",
    "It's the combination of models in a single model, rather than having outcome of a single model we had the outcme of several models combined, because of it's good to learn once ,so it's better to learn several times in several ways.\n",
    "###### Error in Ensemble learning \n",
    "The error emerging from any model can be broken down into three components mathematically.   \n",
    "$Err(x)=(E[\\hat(f)(x)] - f(x))^2+E[\\hat(f)(x) - E[\\hat(f)(x)]]^2+\\sigma_e^2$  \n",
    "$Err(x) = Bias^2+Variance+Irreducible Error$\n",
    "1. **Variance** Models with a high variance overfit data i.e. it memorises the data. High variance implies that the model is sensitive to even small fluctuations in the data. Instead of having a generalized model, it models on the noise that is present in the data. Although it performs excellently on training data, its performance is worse on test data.\n",
    "2. **Bias** Models having a high bias underfit the data. It means that it fails to take a note of the key relations between the features and the target variable. It is due to our inability to represent the true best predictor.\n",
    "3. **Irreducible Error** It means the minimum error that can be achieved and cannot be further predicted. It relates to the inherent noise that is present in the data and represents a lower bound on the error of any learning algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Tradeoff \n",
    "![model_complexity.png](attachment:model_complexity.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How Ensemble learning works ?\n",
    "There are a lots of algorithms and techniques used for example:\n",
    "###### Bagging\n",
    "At first, multiple datasets are created by dividing the original data set. These datasets are then classified into various classes (Bootstrap) finally the classifiers are then combined to give a final prediction (Aggregation).\n",
    "![Featured-Image-10-700x502.png](attachment:Featured-Image-10-700x502.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Main Advantage** It reduces the overfit , Since each of these bags doesn’t contain full information, it cannot memorize the complete training data. Even if the models overfit their ‘bags’, they do not overfit the entire training dataset.\n",
    "- **Main Problem** One of the main problems in employing bagging is that it consumes a lot of resources. It is so because instead of one, we’re training several learners. If there are “k” samples, then the resource usage will approximately increase by k-fold.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### AdaBoost\n",
    "AdaBoost is adaptive in the sense that subsequent weak learners are tweaked in favor of those instances misclassified by previous classifiers. When we collect the set of weak learners, we give equal weights to all of them. But on each round, the weights of incorrectly classified examples are increased so that the weak learner is forced to focus on the hard examples in the training set\n",
    "We’re starting with a simple model- the learner, performs slightly better than chance-. For a binary classifier, ‘chance’ is 50% probability. The model should not leave white-noise  behind.\n",
    "We’re making the model more complex as we iterate through the algorithm. We halt the process after we reach our required level of complexity.\n",
    "![boosting.png](attachment:boosting.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Main Advantage** It decreases the bias Since Boosting keeps on predicting the errors and tries to approximate true-function.\n",
    "- **Main Disadvantage** Actually by trying to fit the observations repeatedly it may overfit. \n",
    "\n",
    "###### Random Forest \n",
    " Random Forest algorithm is a supervised ensemble classification algorithm.There are two stages in Random Forest algorithm, one is random forest creation, the other is to make a predictions.and here is the pseudocode:\n",
    "1. Randomly select “K” features from total “m” features where k << m\n",
    "2. Among the “K” features, calculate the node “d” using the best split point\n",
    "3. Split the node into daughter nodes using the best split\n",
    "4. Repeat the 1 to 3 steps until “l” number of nodes has been reached\n",
    "5. Build forest by repeating steps 1 to 4 for “n” number times to create “n” number of trees\n",
    "6. Take the test features and use the rules of each randomly created decision tree to predict the outcome and stores the predicted outcome (target)\n",
    "7. Calculate the votes for each predicted target\n",
    "8. Consider the high voted predicted target as the final prediction from the random forest algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main Advantages** Random Forest algorithm will avoid the overfitting problem \n",
    "\n",
    "###### Gradient Boosting \n",
    "We first model data with simple models and analyze data for errors.These errors signify data points that are difficult to fit by a simple model.Then for later models, we particularly focus on those hard to fit data to get them right.In the end, we combine all the predictors by giving some weights to each predictor. and here is the pseudocode:\n",
    "1. Fit a simple linear regressor or decision tree on data\n",
    "2. Calculate error residuals. Actual target value, minus predicted target value  \n",
    "$e1= y - y_{predicted1}$\n",
    "3. Fit a new model on error residuals as target variable with same input variables [call it $e1_{predicted}$]\n",
    "4. Add the predicted residuals to the previous predictions\n",
    "$y_{predicted2} = y_{predicted1} + e1_{predicted}$\n",
    "5. Fit another model on residuals that is still left. i.e. $[e2 = y - y_{predicted2}]$ and repeat steps 2 to 5 until it starts overfitting or the sum of residuals become constant. Overfitting can be controlled by consistently checking accuracy on validation data.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Python code\n",
    "**Bagging**\n",
    "```python  \n",
    "from sklearn.ensemble import BaggingClassifier\n",
    "clf=BaggingClassifier(base_estimator=None,n_estimator = 10)\n",
    "#when base estimator is none then it will use Decision trees\n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
