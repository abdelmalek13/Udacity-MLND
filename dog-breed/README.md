# Project Overview
This is Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project! In this project, we will learn how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, our algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
